Use the provided healthcare and demographic datasets and external APIs to perform comprehensive health outcomes analysis.

Datasets provided:
- `health-indicators.csv`: Life expectancy, infant mortality, and healthcare expenditure by country (2020-2022)
- `disease-data.json`: Global disease statistics including cases, deaths, and case fatality rates
- `hospitals.json`: World's top hospitals with rankings, locations, and bed capacity

External data sources to use:
1. Get current disease outbreak information from `https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all` (free COVID-19 API)
2. Extract health statistics from the Wikipedia page "List of countries by life expectancy" at:
   `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy`

Return a JSON object with keys:
- `avg_life_expectancy_improvement`: average life expectancy improvement 2020-2022 across all countries
- `highest_healthcare_spender_2022`: country with highest healthcare expenditure as % of GDP in 2022
- `total_hospital_beds`: total number of hospital beds across all top hospitals
- `life_expectancy_healthcare_correlation`: correlation between life expectancy and healthcare spending
- `most_deadly_disease_2022`: disease with highest case fatality rate in 2022
- `health_factors_wikipedia`: array of top 5 health factors mentioned in Wikipedia article
- `current_covid_stats`: object with current global COVID cases, deaths, and recovery rate from API
- `life_expectancy_trends`: base64 PNG line chart showing life expectancy trends by country, under 100kB
- `healthcare_vs_outcomes_scatter`: base64 PNG scatter plot of healthcare spending vs life expectancy, under 100kB
- `hospital_distribution_map`: base64 PNG world map showing top hospital locations, under 100kB
- `health_forecast_2030`: predicted global life expectancy for 2030 using polynomial regression
- `regional_health_analysis`: object with health outcomes for developed vs developing countries
- `high_mortality_countries_count`: count of countries with infant mortality >20 per 1000 births
- `healthcare_efficiency_score`: calculated score based on health outcomes vs spending
- `disease_network_graph`: base64 PNG network visualization showing disease burden relationships, under 100kB
