Get information about the largest internet companies. Use only the following page that has tabular information as the source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_Internet_companies

Then analyze the provided `user-behavior.csv` dataset containing:
- `user_id`: unique identifier
- `session_duration_min`: session length in minutes  
- `pages_viewed`: number of pages viewed
- `cart_items`: items added to cart
- `purchase_amount`: purchase value in USD (0 if no purchase)
- `device_type`: mobile/desktop/tablet
- `traffic_source`: organic/paid/social/direct
- `time_spent_on_product_pages_min`: time on product pages

Return a JSON object with keys:
-⁠ `top_3_internet_companies` ⁠: array of top 3 company names by revenue, headquartered in China
- `total_users`: number
- `conversion_rate`: percentage (users with purchases / total users)
- `avg_session_duration`: number (minutes)
- `session_purchase_correlation`: correlation between session duration and purchase amount
- `device_performance`: object with conversion rates by device type
- `traffic_source_analysis`: object with average purchase amounts by source
- `user_segmentation_chart`: base64 PNG scatter plot of session duration vs purchase amount, colored by device type, under 100kB
- `conversion_funnel_chart`: base64 PNG funnel chart showing: visitors → cart adds → purchases, under 100kB
- `predictive_model_accuracy`: R² score from linear regression model predicting purchase amount using session duration, pages viewed, and cart items
- `outlier_detection`: array of user_ids that are outliers in purchase behavior (>2 std dev from mean)
- `geospatial_heatmap`: base64 PNG heatmap showing purchase density by hypothetical lat/lng coordinates (generate random coordinates for top purchasers), under 100kB

Answer these questions:
1.⁠ ⁠What are the top 3 largest internet companies by revenue, headquartered in China?
2. How many total users are in the dataset?
3. What is the overall conversion rate (percentage of users who made a purchase)?
4. What is the average session duration across all users?
5. What is the correlation between session duration and purchase amount?
6. What are the conversion rates for each device type?
7. What are the average purchase amounts by traffic source?
8. Create a scatter plot showing session duration vs purchase amount, colored by device type
9. Create a conversion funnel visualization showing the progression from visitors to purchases
10. Build a linear regression model to predict purchase amount and report its R² accuracy
11. Identify users who are outliers in purchase behavior (statistical anomaly detection)
12. Generate a geospatial heatmap of purchase activity using synthetic coordinates
