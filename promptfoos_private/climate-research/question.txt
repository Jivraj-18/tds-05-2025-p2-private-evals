Use the provided climate datasets and external APIs to perform comprehensive climate analysis.

Datasets provided:
- `temperature-anomalies.csv`: Global temperature anomalies by year (1880-2023)
- `co2-emissions.json`: CO2 emissions data by country and year
- `weather-stations.json`: Global weather station locations with metadata

External data sources to use:
1. Scrape current climate data from `https://wttr.in/{city_name}` with query parameter `format=j1`, choose a random city of your choice
2. Extract climate research findings from the Wikipedia page "Effects of climate change" at:
   `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change`

Return a JSON object with keys:
