Analyze social media security threats using the provided datasets and external intelligence sources.

Datasets provided:
- `user-posts.json`: Social media posts with metadata, sentiment scores, and engagement metrics
- `network-connections.csv`: User connections/friendship data for network analysis  
- `security-incidents.csv`: Reported security incidents (phishing, malware, account takeovers)

External data sources to integrate:
1. Scrape recent cybersecurity threat intelligence from the NIST CVE database page at:
   https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search (focus on social media related vulnerabilities)
2. Use LLM sentiment analysis and text extraction on the provided social media posts

Return a JSON object with keys:
- `total_posts_analyzed`: number of posts in dataset
- `high_risk_users`: array of user_ids with suspicious activity patterns
- `sentiment_distribution`: object with counts of positive/negative/neutral posts
- `phishing_detection_rate`: percentage of successfully identified phishing attempts
- `network_centrality_analysis`: object with top 5 most influential users by betweenness centrality
- `threat_intelligence_summary`: array of latest 5 CVE vulnerabilities related to social platforms
- `malicious_content_classification`: object with counts of different threat types detected
- `user_behavior_anomalies`: array of user_ids showing statistical anomalies in posting patterns
- `social_network_graph`: base64 PNG network visualization showing user connections colored by risk level, under 100kB
- `threat_timeline_chart`: base64 PNG time series showing security incidents over time by type, under 100kB  
- `sentiment_heatmap`: base64 PNG heatmap of sentiment scores across user demographics, under 100kB
- `risk_assessment_dashboard`: base64 PNG dashboard showing key security metrics and alerts, under 100kB
- `predictive_threat_model`: predicted number of security incidents next month based on trend analysis
- `geospatial_threat_map`: base64 PNG world map showing geographic distribution of security incidents, under 100kB
- `content_moderation_metrics`: object with precision/recall scores for automated threat detection

Answer these questions:
1. How many social media posts were analyzed in total?
2. Which users exhibit the highest risk behavioral patterns?
3. What is the overall sentiment distribution across all posts?
4. What percentage of phishing attempts were successfully detected by the system?
5. Who are the top 5 most influential users based on network centrality analysis?
6. What are the latest 5 CVE vulnerabilities affecting social media platforms?
7. What types of malicious content were detected and in what quantities?
8. Which users show statistical anomalies in their posting behavior patterns?
9. Create a network graph visualization showing user connections colored by security risk level
10. Plot security incidents over time broken down by incident type
11. Generate a sentiment analysis heatmap across different user demographics
